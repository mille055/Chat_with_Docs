Q:  What is a protocol? How do I change the protocol?
A: The protocol on a Visage 7 client refers not only to the display of data, but also
incorporates the tools that will be available by default in the toolbar, certain window-levels
which may be applied to viewports, and whether the linking of datasets is enabled by
default. You will have more than one option for the loaded protocol. Navigate to the top
left of the screen and click on �Protocol�, then choose a different protocol to load if
needed.

Q: What is a layout? How do I change layouts?
A: A layout dictates the way images are displayed in the viewer. They are configured as part of
the hanging protocol. The user can change layouts by clicking on a different layout from the
layout toolbar. They can also be re-arranged by clicking and dragging them to a more
prominent place within the layout toolbar.

Q: How do I add to default layouts?
A: The function of �Add to Default Layouts� allows the user to quickly set a different layout as
their preference to load into next time they open up a similar exam. The system will
remember the last added default layout. Anytime a change is made to the layout menu (setting a default, hiding, adding, or re- arranging any layout), the user must right click again on any layout and hit �Save Layout Preferences� for the changes to apply. Remember changes apply only to the Protocol they were done for.

not linked, there are a few different ways they can be linked. You can use the linking tools
in the toolbar, selecting as the first option the �Automatically Link Viewers� button.

A: Some protocols may link series within a study automatically upon loading. When series are
not linked, there are a few different ways they can be linked. You can use the linking tools
in the toolbar, selecting as the first option the �Automatically Link Viewers� button.

Q: How do I know which series are being displayed and if I have viewed all images?
A: There are various indicators in the lower-right hand corners of the thumbnails that will
differ depending on the data.

Q: How is volumetric data displayed?
A: Volumetric data is shown with a single cube in the lower left corner of the thumbnail. This
means the thumbnail contains a single volume. For volumetric data, a green border around a thumbnail indicates that this image set is currently shown in the active viewer. Click a thumbnail with a green border to highlight the active viewer briefly.A green triangle in the lover right corner of a thumbnail indicates that this dataset is shown in one of the viewers on the screen.
A grey triangle in the lover right corner indicates that this dataset had been displayed in a
viewer at some point but has since been unloaded.

Q: Can a user set a preference of "Show warning if not all images have been viewed"
for the system to notify a user when all images in a study have not been viewed upon
closing the current session?
A: There is a tool called �Show Unseen Images Warning� that can be manually triggered at any
time via tool palette or applying it to a keyboard shortcut.This warning would include all images in the study, including localizers and non-diagnostic series such as calibration images.

Q: Once I make changes to my user profile will I have to set those features up again or will it save?
A: Specific user preferences (W/L presets, Keyboard Shortcuts, and Tool Palate) will be saved
to the user profile and always follow the user, regardless of the workstation they are using.
Changes in font and icon sizes are stored for monitors of approximately the same size as
the monitor where this change was made. The only configurations that will NOT follow the
user to different workstations are monitor configuration. Monitor configuration changes
will need to be set up once per workstation.

Q: How do I change the W/L presets and create custom W/L presets?
A: Select File>Preferences>Window/Level Presets or select Window/Level Presets from the
viewer controls (in bottom left-hand corner of viewport). Custom W/L presets can be
chosen for the modality for which you want to define a preset and a preset number. Preset numbers correspond to the NUMERIC (0-9) keyboard shortcuts that you can use to
select presets quickly while you are reading images. W/L presets cannot be mapped to
alphabetic letters.

Similar preferences exist for current and future studies as well.

Q: How do I change font, toolbar, or thumbnail sizes?
A: By holding CNTRL + scrolling the scroll wheel while hovering over viewer text, toolbar, or
thumbnails. Scroll the mouse wheel up to increase text size and scroll down to decrease
text size.

Q: How do I know if there are any additional studies in the archive?
A: If there are additional studies in an archive, Visage will prompt the user with a blue
hyperlink at the bottom of the study navigator which reads �Load additional studies from
Archive�. After clicking on the hyperlink, the user will have an option to import them to the
Visage cache from the archive.

Q: What is the red folder icon in the corner of each viewer?
A: The red folder icon provides a user with the access to the list of the series of all currently
loaded studies.

Q: How do I turn off the patient information if it is covering the anatomy?
A: Hit the space bar to toggle through the levels of verbosity, or you can use the �Toggle
Patient/Study data� tool.

Q: How do I anonymize images?
A: The space bar is a quick way to hide DICOM overlays including patient demographics.
Toggle patient/study data tool hides patient demographics while preserving other overlays,
such as annotations and measurements, and crosshairs. Privacy mode can be enabled via File > privacy mode to hide patient data but preserve the
overlays of technical factors.  De-identify from study browser if you need to create fully de-identified copy of the study.

Q: What is the difference between saving presentation states and secondary captures?
A: Presentation state is a way to save attributes such as W/L, Rotate/Flip, and
annotations/measurements so that the study loads that way the next time someone loads
the study. Unlike the secondary captures, the Presentation State features can be applied
interactively � for example, the annotations may be hidden with a single click.  A secondary capture is a snapshot of a viewer or of multiple viewers. When creating the
snapshot, Visage captures exact pixels that are displayed to the user, including not only the
image(s) but also all text and graphic overlays. When such an image is displayed, the text
and graphics cannot be interactively hidden since a separate DICOM series will be saved as
a secondary capture.

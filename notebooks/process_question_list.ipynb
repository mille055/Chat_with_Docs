They can also be re-arranged by clicking and dragging them to a more prominent place within the layout toolbar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Q: How do I add to default layouts?\n",
      "Answer: A: The function of ï¿½Add to Default Layoutsï¿½ allows the user to quickly set a different layout as their preference to load into next time they open up a similar exam. The system will remember the last added default layout. Anytime a change is made to the layout menu (setting a default, hiding, adding, or re- arranging any layout), the user must right click again on any layout and hit ï¿½Save Layout Preferencesï¿½ for the changes to apply. Remember changes apply only to the Protocol they were done for.\n",

      "Question: Q: Once I make changes to my user profile will I have to set those features up again or will it save?\n",
      "Answer: A: Specific user preferences (W/L presets, Keyboard Shortcuts, and Tool Palate) will be saved to the user profile and always follow the user, regardless of the workstation they are using. Changes in font and icon sizes are stored for monitors of approximately the same size as the monitor where this change was made.

      "Question: Q: What is the difference between saving presentation states and secondary captures?\n",
      "Answer: A: Presentation state is a way to save attributes such as W/L, Rotate/Flip, and annotations/measurements so that the study loads that way the next time someone loads the study. Unlike the secondary captures, the Presentation State features can be applied interactively ï¿½ for example, the annotations may be hidden with a single click.  A secondary capture is a snapshot of a viewer or of multiple viewers. When creating the snapshot, Visage captures exact pixels that are displayed to the user, including not only the image(s) but also all text and graphic overlays. When such an image is displayed, the text and graphics cannot be interactively hidden since a separate DICOM series will be saved as a secondary capture.\n",

imaging solution based entirely on efficient thi n-client streaming tech-\\nnology. It scales easily from a single radiology practice to la rge distributed health-\\ncare enterprises and allows efficient viewing, processing, and archiving of very large \\nnumbers of images, including thin-slice volumetric data from CT , MR, PET-CT, and \\nother 3D modalities.\\nIntended use\\nVisage 7 is a system for distributing, viewing, processing, and  archiving medical \\nimages in healthcare environments. The Visage 7 server receives  image data in \\nDICOM format via network. This provides flexible connections to  archives, modali-\\nties, and workstations. Modalities supported by Visage 7 are li sted in the DICOM \\nConformance Statement.\\nAside from general image interpretation and processing tools, V isage 7 provides \\nspecific tool sets for several clinical applications, including : \\n• CT/MR angiography, for example, for vascular analysis and sten t planning\\n• Cardiac analysis, including calcium scoring and functional ass essment of car-\\ndiac CT data \\n• Neuroradiology, including CT and MR brain perfusion analysis• Oncology, including SUV analysis and lesion marking and analys is\\nVisage is to be used only by trained and instructed healthcare professionals. It can \\nsupport physicians and/or their medical staff in providing thei r own diagnosis for \\nmedical cases. The final decision regarding diagnoses, however,  resides with the \\ndoctors and/or their medical staff in their own area of respons ibility. Although the \\nWeb and thin-client technologies allow the software to be run o n a variety of hard-\\nware platforms, for diagnostic purposes the user must ensure th at the display hard-\\nware used for reading the images complies with state-of-the-art  diagnostic \\nrequirements and currently valid laws. \\nOnly DICOM for presentation images can be used on an FDA approv ed monitor for \\nmammography for primary image diagnosis. Only uncompressed or n onlossy com-\\npressed images must be used for primary image diagnosis in mamm ography.', 9: \"Data protection and data security Intended use, data security, a nd system requirements\\n10 Visage 7 Data protection and data security\\nPatient data is subject to data protection. Therefore, users ha ve to ensure compli-\\nance with all applicable laws and regulations in their country.  Visage 7 provides \\nextensive security mechanisms that help you assure data protect ion and data secu-\\nrity. On the administration platform, the system administrator can activate the audit \\ntrail option to comply with the strict regulations regarding se curity and privacy of \\nhealth data (HIPAA) according to US law.\\nSystem requirements\\nWith Visage 7, all image data is stored on the server at all ti mes. Users access the \\ndata directly on the server from any number of radiology workst ations, office PCs, \\nlaptop computers, or other devices. Image data does not need to  be sent to client \\ncomputers in the process. Instead, Visage 7 employs a technique  that is called thin-\\nclient streaming  or thin-client computing . All image processing (2D, 3D, or 4D) is \\nperformed on the server. \\nServer hardware consists of standard server platforms, but they  must be qualified \\nby Visage Imaging. For a detailed server hardware and software specification, con-\\ntact customer support.\\nClient computers neither need to hold large volumes of data nor  do they need to \\nperform any of the actual image processing. Therefore, system r equirements for \\nVisage 7 Client computers are minimal as far as memory, graphic s, or computing \\npower is concerned. As a result, the Visage 7 Client can be ins talled on virtually any \\nstandard computer or standard laptop with a network connection.  Visage 7 supports \\nall recent versions of Windows® and Mac OS. With Visage 7, Mac and Windows \\nusers can work together in a fully integrated environment and w orkflow. \\nDetailed system requirements are documented in the release note s, which are \\navailable on your Visage 7 server's download page.Caution\\nFor data security reasons, it is not permitted to make changes to the Visage prod-\\nuct and its database.

Therefore, a mask is \\ncomputed from the first phase of the perfusion image series. Th e mask includes \\nonly voxels with values between the Min and Max values that are defined here.

The volume of blood plasma varies \\nwith the vessel size, which is specified by the hematocrit rati o between small and \\nlarge vessels.

Moreover, the system expects you to edit some aspects dire ctly in the View  win-\\ndow and adapt others with the protocol editing commands on the Protocol  menu.\\nThe workflow for protocol modification therefore comprises the following steps:\\n1.Loading appropriate image data into the View  window\\nChoose a study that is typical for the cases for which you want  to create a new \\nprotocol.\\n2.Selecting a base protocol on the Protocol  menu\\nChoose a protocol that resembles the one you want to create.\\nThe protocol editing options of the Visage 7 Client do not perm it you to modify or \\ndefine all aspects of a protocol. Therefore, it is important that you star t protocol \\nediting with a protocol that interprets the data in the correct  way. In particular, \\nensure that all images or image stacks that you want to present  are available as \\nthumbnails. If you cannot find a suitable protocol, contact cus tomer service.\\n3.Creating and editing layouts\\nA layout defines the arrangement of viewers on the screen. See Edit Layout dia-\\nlog box , page 186.\\n4.Editing image assignment\\nImage assignment defines criteria for selecting images or image  stacks and for \\nshowing them in the viewers of a layout. Typically, you combine  interactive \\nimage selection in the View  window and definition of criteria in the Image \\nAssignment  dialog box in this step. See Image Assignment dialog box , page \\n188.\\nIf you define no image assignment rules, images are distributed  across viewers \\nin the order in which they were acquired.\\n5.Adapting image display and tool selection\\nUse the tools of the View  window to modify image display settings such as slice \\nthickness, rendering modes, window level settings, or viewer li nking. Also show \\ntools and tool cards as required.\\n6.Saving the protocol\\nUse the Save Protocol  dialog box to save the modified protocol and to change \\nits name, priority, access and matching criteria. See Save Protocol dialog box , \\npage 189.Tip\\nWe recommend that you attend a training course before you attem pt to perform \\nthese tasks. Alternatively, leave these tasks to trained admini strators or Visage \\nImaging service personnel.', 185: 'Properties and protocols Customizing Visage 7 Client\\n186 Visage 7 Defining conditions Conditions are rules that help Visage 7 to identify specific ty pes of images. See Edit \\nConditions dialog box , page 191.\\nService-level protocol \\neditingThe various options and dialog boxes for advanced protocol edit ing allow adaptation \\nof existing protocols or definition of new protocols based on e xisting protocols.\\nVisage 7 Client users are not permitted to build protocols from  scratch or to modify \\ncertain protocol properties which, if modified incorrectly, mig ht render the system \\nunusable. This level is reserved for service personnel who have  been trained for \\nthese tasks specifically.\\nEdit Layout dialog box\\nIn the Edit Layout  dialog box, you can configure layouts for the protocol that is  cur-\\nrently active. \\n1.Before you open the Edit Layout  dialog box, inspect the layouts of your current \\nprotocol.\\nBy default, Visage 7 hides layouts that are not suitable for th e currently loaded \\ndata.
